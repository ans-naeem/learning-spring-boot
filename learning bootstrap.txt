Note:
We dont need to tell explicitly where the task is placed it automatically have a bird's eye view of the project and know where it is.


spring boot 2.1.17 is not compatible with java 21 we need to downgrade it to 17 to make it compatible
other wise errors occurs while executing the code.



to find the proccess id listening to the specific port:
------------------------------------------------------
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

to kill some task:

taskkill /PID 21192 /F


Annotations:
--------------
@RestController to tell this is a controller
@RequestMappings to tell this controller maps to this request same like in flask we do 
		@app.route('/')
		def index():     
		  ...

In Spring boot we do 

@RestController 
public class controller
{
	@RequestMappings('/hello')
	{
		return ...;
	}
}


@PathVariable to tell the spring boot that use the integer variable passed in the URL.
@AutoWired use Some specific Service or (interface) inside the controller very important topic called dependency Injection

@Service is use to define some service which controller called by instansiating the service class with autowired anotation.

@requestbody is use to bind the http request object with the (POJO) java object.

@Entity is use to tell the JPA that its an entity and shouldbe mapped.

@Id is use to tell its a primary key and can be used to uniquely identify the data.
